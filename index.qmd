Welcome!
<br>
<br>
I am a Ph.D. Candidate studying Political Science and International Affairs at the University of Georgia. My major field is International Relations, while my minor field is Political Methodology.
<br>
<br>
Prior to enrolling at the University of Georgia, I earned my Master of Arts in Political Science with an Emphasis in International Relations and Comparative Politics from San Diego State University in May 2018. Before that, I earned my Bachelor of Arts in International Security and Conflict Resolution with a Concentration in Cooperation, Conflict, and Conflict Resolution from San Diego State University in May 2014. Additionally, I minored in Islamic and Arabic Studies.
<br>
<br>
My research interests include intrastate armed conflict, how indiscriminate violence is utilized, and how levels of indiscriminate violence may vary according to conflict type. Additionally, I am interested in the relationship between levels of nationalism and respect for human rights. Finally, I have an interest in the intersection of human rights with international law, and with international criminal courts and tribunals.
